# Hypothesis: Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines? I say thry are inversely proportional
# Variable in the mpg dataset that gives info about engine size is displacement --> displ
# Variable in the mpg dataset that gives info about fuel efficiency is hwy

# Confirmed hypothesis
