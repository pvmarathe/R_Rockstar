0. Whats your hypothesis ? 


1. Ted Talks Definition of POpularity

Check 3rd quartile for views
Check 3rd quartile for comments. 
Ted Talks that satisfy both those conditions


2. Number of speakers and duration. Is there any correlation

3. Comments and Views yearly trend. Is there any trend?

4. The maximum value of published - filmed date i 13880. Check for outliers. 
It is skewing the published - filmed date variable

5. Scatter plot of duration and views for only popular ted talks and see
if there is any trend in scatterplot

6. When you plot views vs comments, find the outliers especially the 
one that has 6000 comments

7. Correlation Matrix

The sheer number of languages it's available in demands a little more inspection though as it has just over 8 million views, far fewer than the most popular TED Talks.
#Finally, let us check if there is a correlation between the number of views and the number of languages a talk is availbale in. We would think that this should be the case since the talk is more accessible to a larger number of people but as Matt Cutts' talk shows, it may not really be the case.
